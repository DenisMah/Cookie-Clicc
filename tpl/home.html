    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <span> </span>
    <p>
      International Burch Bakery was founded in 2021 by a group of enthusiastic
      professors and students at International Burch University. What started as
      a casual baking club quickly turned into a passion project that combined
      education and culinary delight. The idea was simple: if we could teach
      complex theories and solve equations, why not bake the best cookies in the
      world?
